#  MinGW toolchain
#
#  We're using the MinGW toolchain that exists on the host,
#  but we need to make it possible to run wine somehow,
#  using the DLLs compiled by our users' dependencies.
#
#  Therefore,
#  - the `make` class captures the dependency list as MAKE_ALL_PATHS
#    (BOB_ALL_PATHS is not an exported environment variable)
#  - we generate a tool `winerunner` that uses it to build a WINEPATH
#  - the `env::mingw32` class publishes `winerunner` as RUN
#
