#  DOS environment
#
#  From bob's point of view, this is the same as a "noarch" environment
#  because it doesn't produce anything retargetable to different environments.
#  It therefore provides only host tools.
#
#  If we eventually provide a sandbox using a DOS emulator, this will be
#  set up here as well.
#
#  Consumers will also use class 'dos' to get commands to interact with
#  the DOS execution environment.
